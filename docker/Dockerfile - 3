# Run container 
# docker container run --rm -it my-example bash

# source to get activate conda virtual env in container:

# REMARK - if log into the container and then try `conda activate sacha` I got an error message.
# The following solves the issue
# $ source activate base
# $ conda activate sacha

# changed below to use anaconda3 image instead of python:3.10-slim
